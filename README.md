# 🧠 📖 Bits, Brain and Code (feed your brain)

Welcome to `Bits, Brain and Code` — an evolving collection of studies, experiments, and insights on IT, AI, tech and living (with tech).
This repo works like a knowledge base / living newsletter: new folders, notes, and code snippets would be updated whenever something worth considering was discovered.

Think of it as the second brain for tech — free and open for anyone curious.

### 📂 Repository Structure

The repo is organized into folders. Each folder is either:
- Editorial Notes → articles, study notes, or write-ups.
- Code Experiments → small projects, scripts, or demos. (for larger, more serious experiments, the code would be hosted on a separate `GitHub` Repo instead)

sample repo structure as follows (notes: the actual repo structure might be different based on actual categorization)
```

├── ai/             # AI & ML notes, experiments
├── code
│   ├── rust/       # Rust programming notes & code
│   └── golang/     # Golang learnings & snippets
